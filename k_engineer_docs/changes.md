# Changes Made

- On api/auth/register i commented isPublicSignupEnabled function
- on userMenu i commented out log out button
- Modified src/store/task.ts to handle auto-scheduling errors gracefully - if auto-scheduling fails, it will log a warning but won't prevent task operations from completing
- Modified src/app/api/tasks/schedule-all/route.ts to automatically create default auto-schedule settings (Mon-Fri, 9 AM to 5 PM) if they don't exist
